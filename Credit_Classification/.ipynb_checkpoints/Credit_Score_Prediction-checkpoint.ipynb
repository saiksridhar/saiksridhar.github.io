    "# Credit Score Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Credit Score classification dataset explored includes a number of customer features over the first 8 months of a given year. These include key customer features such as the number of products, cashflow, arrears, total repayments and the like which should allow a good view of customer behaviour and hence support the prediction of the next 4 months of customer credit scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit Scoring enables credit decisioning and pricing (such as interest rates) to support an optimised portfolio for the institution in line with profitablility targets and risk apetite. This is vital to the survival and success of any financial institution which issues lending products.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the data is a time series per customer, credit scores would be typically be determined at a point in time. Average of previous performance metrics would be considered however. The approach in this notebook is to experiment with various Neural Network configurations in order to develop predictive algorithm for the financial institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary challenges dealt with in this classification process are data cleansing, imputation and model development. Custom imputers have been developed in this Notebook along with testing of the imputed features during the model training phase. Additionally, various configurations and approaches are taken to develop a predictive neural network model."
