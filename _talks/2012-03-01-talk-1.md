## [U.S. Crime Trends from 1979 - 2022](https://public.tableau.com/views/WorkinProgress_17120271257940/USCrimeTrends1979to2022-Frame?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
The following visualization explores U.S. crime data by state as made publically available by the FBI. Crime is shown at an overall level down to a breakdown of violent and property crimes. An interactive map of the U.S. enables the user to uncover deeper insights at state level to understand:

- Trends by crime types
- Rankings of states across crime types
